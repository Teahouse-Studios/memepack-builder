This is a small, simple program, so there will be bugs and issues. If you find one, please open an issue. Describe the circumstance as clearly as possible. The author may not have the ability to fix all issues, please forgive that :)

Also, you can use pull requests to commit your changes and improvements. Any kind of fix is welcome.
